-------------------------------A sign up page by Free Code Camp--------------------------------------------

In this project I learned HTML forms to create a sign up page that's helped me to control different kind of data
and other CSS tools.

In HTML:
- method="get" or "post": I learned what are the differences between them and basically to send data I have to use "post" request and to get data I have to use the other "get";

-I created most of used form's inputs used in sign up page;

In CSS:
- Using the vh unit to define the height of the body, it's usefull to have a responsive webpage; 

- I worked with vh and vw unit to help my pageweb to be responsive and combining with heigth and width of each element;
